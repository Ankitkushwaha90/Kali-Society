### Setting up a Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) lab in Kali Linux is a great way to learn about web application security and penetration testing techniques. Here's a step-by-step tutorial to guide you through the process:

### Step 1: Install Kali Linux
If you haven't already, download and install Kali Linux on your system. You can get the latest version from the official Kali Linux website.

### Step 2: Install DVWA
- 1.Open a terminal window in Kali Linux.
- 2.Update the package repository by running:

sql
```bash
sudo apt update
```
- 3.Install the required packages for DVWA:
```bash
sudo apt install apache2 php mysql-server php-mysql
```

- 4.Clone the DVWA repository from GitHub:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ethicalhack3r/DVWA /var/www/html/DVWA
```
- 5.Change the ownership of the DVWA directory to the Apache user:
kotlin
```bash
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/DVWA
```
- 6.Navigate to the DVWA directory:
```bash
cd /var/www/html/DVWA
```
- 7.Copy the DVWA configuration file:
arduino
```bash 
cp config/config.inc.php.dist config/config.inc.php
```
- 8.Open the DVWA configuration file:
arduino
```bash
nano config/config.inc.php
```
- 9.Modify the database settings according to your MySQL setup. Change the values of db_user, db_password, and db_database to your MySQL username, password, and database name respectively.
### Step 3: Set Up the Database
- 1.Log in to MySQL:
```bash
mysql -u root -p
- 2.Create a new database for DVWA:
```
sql
```bash 
CREATE DATABASE dvwa;
- 3.Grant privileges to the DVWA database user:
sql
```bash
GRANT ALL ON dvwa.* TO 'yourusername'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'yourpassword';
```
Replace 'yourusername' and 'yourpassword' with your desired username and password.
- 4. Exit MySQL:
```bash
exit
``` 
### Step 4: Configure PHP Settings
- 1.Open the php.ini file:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/php/7.x/apache2/php.ini
``` 
Replace 7.x with your PHP version.
- 2.Find the following lines and set them as follows:
```graphql
allow_url_include = On
allow_url_fopen = On
```
- 3.Save and close the file.
### Step 5: Start the Apache and MySQL Services
- 1.Start Apache:
```sql
sudo service apache2 start
```
- 2.Start MySQL:
```sql
sudo service mysql start
```
### Step 6: Access DVWA
- 1.Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost/DVWA/setup.php.
- 2.Follow the instructions to set up DVWA. Make sure to create the database and set the security level.
- 3.After setup, you can access DVWA at http://localhost/DVWA/index.php.
That's it! You've successfully set up DVWA on your Kali Linux system. Now you can start exploring and learning about web application security. Remember to use this lab responsibly and ethically.
