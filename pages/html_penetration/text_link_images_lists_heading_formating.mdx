# HTML Basics: Text Formatting, Headings, Lists, Links, and Images

In this tutorial, we'll cover the fundamentals of HTML, focusing on text formatting, headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and images.

### Text Formatting with HTML

HTML provides several tags for text formatting, including `<strong>` for bold text, `<em>` for italic text, `<u>` for underlined text, and `<s>` for strikethrough text.

```html
<p>This is <strong>bold</strong> text.</p>
<p>This is <em>italic</em> text.</p>
<p>This is <u>underlined</u> text.</p>
<p>This is <s>strikethrough</s> text.</p>
```
### Working with Headings
HTML offers six levels of headings, from `<h1>` (the most important) to `<h6>` (the least important). Headings are used to structure and organize content on a webpage.

```html
<h1>This is Heading 1</h1>
<h2>This is Heading 2</h2>
<h3>This is Heading 3</h3>
<h4>This is Heading 4</h4>
<h5>This is Heading 5</h5>
<h6>This is Heading 6</h6>
```
### Adding Paragraphs
Paragraphs are created using the `<p>` tag. They are used to group text content together and create logical divisions in a webpage.

```html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>
```
### Working with Lists
HTML supports two types of lists: ordered lists (`<ol>`) and unordered lists (`<ul>`). Items in ordered lists are numbered, while items in unordered lists are bulleted.

```html
<h3>Ordered List:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
    <li>Item 3</li>
</ol>

<h3>Unordered List:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
    <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>
```
### Adding Links
Links are created using the `<a>` tag. They allow users to navigate between different web pages or sections within the same page.

```html
<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example Website</a>
```
### Adding Images
Images are inserted using the `<img>` tag. The `src` attribute specifies the URL of the image, and the `alt` attribute provides alternative text for accessibility.

```html
<img src="example.jpg" alt="Example Image">
```
### Conclusion
HTML basics are essential for building web pages. By mastering text formatting, headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and images, you'll be well-equipped to create engaging and well-structured web content.
