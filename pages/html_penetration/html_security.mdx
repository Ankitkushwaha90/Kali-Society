# Introduction to HTML Security

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the backbone of the web, serving as the standard markup language for creating web pages. However, with its widespread use comes the potential for security vulnerabilities that malicious actors can exploit. In this section, we'll explore the importance of HTML security and common threats associated with it.

## Importance of HTML Security

HTML security is crucial for safeguarding web applications and protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access and manipulation. Failure to address HTML security vulnerabilities can lead to various risks, including data breaches, unauthorized data modification, and denial of service attacks.

## Common Security Threats Associated with HTML

HTML-based web applications are vulnerable to a range of security threats, including:

1. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** XSS attacks occur when malicious scripts are injected into web pages and executed in the browsers of unsuspecting users. This can lead to theft of sensitive information, session hijacking, and other malicious activities.

2. **HTML Injection:** HTML injection involves inserting malicious HTML code into web pages to manipulate their behavior or appearance. Attackers can exploit HTML injection vulnerabilities to perform various actions, such as defacement of web pages or redirection to malicious sites.

3. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** CSRF attacks exploit the trust that a web application has in a user's browser by tricking users into executing unintended actions on the application without their knowledge or consent. This can result in unauthorized transactions or data manipulation.

## Overview of HTML Injection and Its Impact

HTML injection is a type of attack where an attacker injects malicious HTML code into a web page, which is then executed by the victim's browser. This can have various impacts, including:

- **Defacement:** Attackers may inject HTML code to modify the appearance of a web page, such as replacing content with offensive or malicious material.

- **Phishing:** HTML injection can be used to create fake login forms or other deceptive elements on a web page, leading users to disclose sensitive information such as usernames and passwords.

- **Client-Side Attacks:** By injecting malicious scripts, attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in users' browsers to execute arbitrary code, steal cookies, or perform other malicious actions.

### Example

Consider a scenario where a web application allows users to submit comments that are displayed on a public forum. If the application fails to properly sanitize user input, an attacker could inject malicious HTML code into a comment, such as:

```html
<script>alert('Hello, I am a malicious script!');</script>
```
When other users view the comment, the script will be executed in their browsers, displaying an alert message. This demonstrates how HTML injection can be used to execute arbitrary code in the context of a web application.

Understanding the importance of HTML security and the common threats associated with it is essential for developers and security professionals to effectively protect web applications from exploitation.
