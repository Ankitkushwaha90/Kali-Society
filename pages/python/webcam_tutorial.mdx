# Webcam Tutorial with OpenCV

In this tutorial, we'll create a simple Python script using OpenCV to capture video from a webcam.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system along with the OpenCV library.

## Code Explanation

```python
import cv2

def main():
    # Create a VideoCapture object
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)  # 0 represents the default webcam

    # Check if the webcam is opened correctly
    if not cap.isOpened():
        print("Error: Could not open webcam")
        return

    # Loop to capture frames from the webcam
    while True:
        # Read a frame from the webcam
        ret, frame = cap.read()

        # Check if the frame is successfully captured
        if not ret:
            print("Error: Failed to capture frame")
            break

        # Display the frame
        cv2.imshow('Webcam', frame)

        # Check for 'q' key to quit the program
        if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
            break

    # Release the VideoCapture object and close all OpenCV windows
    cap.release()
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
### How to Run
- 1.Save the code above in a file named `webcam_capture.py`.
- 2.Open a terminal or command prompt.
- 3.Navigate to the directory where `webcam_capture.py` is located.
- 4.Run the script using the command: python `webcam_capture.py`.

### Explanation
- We start by importing the `cv2` module, which is the Python interface for OpenCV.
- The `main()` function initializes the webcam using `cv2.VideoCapture(0)`, where `0` represents the default webcam connected to your system.
- We then enter a loop where we continuously capture frames from the webcam using `cap.read()`.
- Each frame is displayed using `cv2.imshow()` and we check for the 'q' key press using `cv2.waitKey()` to exit the loop and release the webcam when the user presses 'q'.
- Finally, we release the webcam using `cap.release()` and close all OpenCV windows with `cv2.destroyAllWindows()`.
This concludes our tutorial on capturing video from a webcam using OpenCV in Python.
