# Operators in Python

In this tutorial, we'll cover operators in Python, including arithmetic, comparison, logical, assignment, and bitwise operators.

## Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations. Here are some examples:

```python
x = 10
y = 5

print(x + y)  # Addition
print(x - y)  # Subtraction
print(x * y)  # Multiplication
print(x / y)  # Division
print(x % y)  # Modulus
print(x ** y) # Exponentiation
print(x // y) # Floor division
```
### Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are used to compare values. Here are some examples:

```python
x = 10
y = 5

print(x > y)  # Greater than
print(x < y)  # Less than
print(x == y) # Equal to
print(x != y) # Not equal to
print(x >= y) # Greater than or equal to
print(x <= y) # Less than or equal to
```
### Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements. Here are some examples:

```python
x = True
y = False

print(x and y)  # Logical AND
print(x or y)   # Logical OR
print(not x)    # Logical NOT
```
### Assignment Operators
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. Here are some examples:

```python
x = 10
x += 5  # Equivalent to x = x + 5
x -= 5  # Equivalent to x = x - 5
x *= 5  # Equivalent to x = x * 5
x /= 5  # Equivalent to x = x / 5
x %= 5  # Equivalent to x = x % 5
x //= 5 # Equivalent to x = x // 5
x **= 5 # Equivalent to x = x ** 5
```
### Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operators are used to perform bitwise operations on integers. Here are some examples:

```python
x = 10
y = 5

print(x & y)  # Bitwise AND
print(x | y)  # Bitwise OR
print(x ^ y)  # Bitwise XOR
print(~x)     # Bitwise NOT
print(x << y) # Bitwise left shift
print(x >> y) # Bitwise right shift
```
### Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've covered different types of operators in Python, including arithmetic, comparison, logical, assignment, and bitwise operators. Understanding how operators work is essential for writing Python code efficiently.
