# Introduction to Python

Welcome to the introduction to Python! In this tutorial, we'll cover the basics of Python, including its history, features, installation process, and setting up the development environment.

## History and Features of Python

Python was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. It is known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

## Installation of Python

### To install Python, follow these steps:
- 1. Visit the official Python website (python.org).
- 2. Download the appropriate installer for your operating system.
- 3. Run the installer and follow the installation instructions.

## Setting Up Development Environment

After installing Python, you need to set up your development environment. This typically involves:
- Choosing a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) such as VSCode, PyCharm, or Jupyter Notebook.
- Installing additional packages or libraries using pip, the Python package manager.

Now that you're familiar with the basics, let's dive into Python programming!
