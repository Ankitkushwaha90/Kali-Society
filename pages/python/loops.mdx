# Python : Loops

In this tutorial, we'll explore loops in Python programming. Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met.

## Types of Loops in Python

Python supports two main types of loops:

1. **`for` loop**: Used for iterating over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, or range) or an iterable object.
2. **`while` loop**: Executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

## `for` Loop

The `for` loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence or an iterable object. The syntax of the `for` loop is as follows:

```python
for item in iterable:
    # Code block to be executed
```
Here's an example of using a `for` loop to iterate over a list of numbers:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for num in numbers:
    print(num)
```
### `while` Loop
The `while` loop in Python executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. The syntax of the `while` loop is as follows:

```python
while condition:
    # Code block to be executed
```
Here's an example of using a `while` loop to print numbers from 1 to 5:

```python
num = 1
while num <= 5:
    print(num)
    num += 1
```
### Loop Control Statements
Python provides loop control statements to modify the execution of loops:

- `break`: Terminates the loop prematurely.
- `continue`: Skips the current iteration and proceeds to the next iteration of the loop.
- `pass`: Acts as a placeholder, doing nothing when executed.
### Nested Loops
Python allows nesting loops within one another. This means you can use one or more loops inside another loop. Here's an example of a nested for loop:

```python
Copy code
for i in range(3):
    for j in range(3):
        print(f"({i}, {j})")
```
### Conclusion
Loops are powerful constructs in Python for executing code repeatedly. Whether you're iterating over a sequence, performing tasks based on conditions, or implementing nested loops, understanding how to use loops effectively is essential for writing efficient Python programs.
