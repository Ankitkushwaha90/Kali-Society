# Basic Input/Output in Python

In this tutorial, we'll cover the basics of handling input and output in Python.

## Printing Output

To print output in Python, you can use the `print()` function. Here's an example:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```
This will output:
```bash
Hello, world!
```
### Getting Input
To get input from the user in Python, you can use the `input()` function. Here's an example:

```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello,", name)
```
This will prompt the user to enter their name, and then print a greeting with the entered name.

### Example: Simple Calculator
Let's create a simple calculator that takes two numbers as input and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

```python
# Function to add two numbers
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

# Function to subtract two numbers
def subtract(a, b):
    return a - b

# Function to multiply two numbers
def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b

# Function to divide two numbers
def divide(a, b):
    return a / b

# Get input from the user
num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))

# Perform operations
print("Sum:", add(num1, num2))
print("Difference:", subtract(num1, num2))
print("Product:", multiply(num1, num2))
print("Quotient:", divide(num1, num2))
```
This will prompt the user to enter two numbers and then perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on those numbers.

### Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've covered the basics of handling input and output in Python. You should now be comfortable with printing output, getting input from the user, and creating simple programs that utilize these concepts.
