# Data Handling in Python

In this tutorial, we'll cover the basics of handling data effectively in Python.

## Basic Data Types

Python supports various basic data types, including integers, floats, strings, booleans, and more. Here are some examples:

```python
# Integer
x = 10

# Float
y = 3.14

# String
name = "John Doe"

# Boolean
is_student = True
```
### Data Structures
Python provides several data structures to organize and manipulate data efficiently. Some common data structures include lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. Here's how you can use them:

```python
# List
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]

# Tuple
coordinates = (10, 20)

# Dictionary
person = {"name": "John", "age": 30}

# Set
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```
### Data Manipulation Operations
Python offers powerful tools for data manipulation, such as slicing, indexing, iterating, and more. Let's see some examples:

```python
# Slicing
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers[1:3])  # Output: [2, 3]

# Indexing
print(person["name"])  # Output: John

# Iterating
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

# List comprehension
squared_numbers = [x**2 for x in range(1, 6)]
print(squared_numbers)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```
### Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've covered the basics of data handling in Python. You should now have a good understanding of basic data types, data structures, and common data manipulation operations in Python.
