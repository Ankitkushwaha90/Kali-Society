# Using Python Libraries and Modules

In this tutorial, we'll cover how to use Python libraries, create and use modules, work with the `math` and `random` modules, and create and use packages.

## Using Libraries and Modules

Python libraries provide pre-written code for various tasks. You can import and use them in your programs. Here's an example of using the `math` module:

```python
import math

print(math.sqrt(16))  # Output: 4.0
```
### Creating and Using Modules
Modules are Python files containing functions and variables that you can import and use in other Python files. Here's an example of creating and using a module:

```python
# mymodule.py
def greet(name):
    print("Hello,", name)

# main.py
import mymodule

mymodule.greet("John")  # Output: Hello, John
```
### Working with Math Module
The `math` module provides mathematical functions and constants. Here are some examples:

```python
import math

print(math.pi)          # Output: 3.141592653589793
print(math.sin(math.pi/2))  # Output: 1.0
```
### Working with Random Module
The `random` module provides functions for generating random numbers. Here's an example:

```python
import random

print(random.randint(1, 10))  # Output: Random integer between 1 and 10
```
### Creating and Using Packages
Packages are directories containing multiple modules. You can create your own packages and use them in your programs. Here's an example structure:

```markdown
my_package/
├── __init__.py
├── module1.py
└── module2.py
```
You can then import modules from your package:

```python
# main.py
from my_package import module1

module1.function()
```
### Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've covered how to use Python libraries, create and use modules, work with the `math` and `random` modules, and create and use packages. Understanding these concepts will help you write more efficient and organized Python code.
