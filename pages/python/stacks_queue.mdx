# Working with Stacks and Queues in Python

In this tutorial, we'll cover working with stacks and queues in Python, including their definitions, operations, and implementations.

## Stacks

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. It has two main operations: push (to add an item to the top of the stack) and pop (to remove the top item from the stack). Here's an example of a stack implementation using a list:

```python
class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []

    def push(self, item):
        self.items.append(item)

    def pop(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items.pop()

    def is_empty(self):
        return self.items == []

# Example usage
stack = Stack()
stack.push(1)
stack.push(2)
stack.push(3)
print(stack.pop())  # Output: 3
print(stack.pop())  # Output: 2
```
### Queues
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. It has two main operations: enqueue (to add an item to the rear of the queue) and dequeue (to remove the front item from the queue). Here's an example of a queue implementation using a list:

```python
class Queue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []

    def enqueue(self, item):
        self.items.append(item)

    def dequeue(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items.pop(0)

    def is_empty(self):
        return self.items == []

# Example usage

queue = Queue()
queue.enqueue(1)
queue.enqueue(2)
queue.enqueue(3)
print(queue.dequeue())  # Output: 1
print(queue.dequeue())  # Output: 2
```
### Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've covered working with stacks and queues in Python. Understanding these data structures and their operations is essential for solving various problems efficiently in Python.
