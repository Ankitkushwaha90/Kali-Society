# List Operations in Python

In this tutorial, we'll cover searching, insertion, and deletion in lists in Python, including examples and explanations of how to perform these operations.

## Searching in Lists

You can search for elements in a list using various methods, such as the `index()` method or a loop. Here's an example of searching for an element in a list:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Using index() method
index = my_list.index(3)
print("Index of 3:", index)  # Output: Index of 3: 2

# Using a loop
for i, num in enumerate(my_list):
    if num == 3:
        print("Index of 3:", i)
        break
```
### Insertion in Lists
You can insert elements into a list using the insert() method or concatenation. Here's an example of inserting an element into a list:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 5]

# Using insert() method
my_list.insert(3, 4)
print("After insertion:", my_list)  # Output: After insertion: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Using concatenation
my_list = my_list[:3] + [4] + my_list[3:]
print("After insertion:", my_list)  # Output: After insertion: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
### Deletion in Lists
You can delete elements from a list using the remove() method, del statement, or pop() method. Here's an example of deleting an element from a list:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Using remove() method
my_list.remove(3)
print("After deletion:", my_list)  # Output: After deletion: [1, 2, 4, 5]

# Using del statement
del my_list[3]
print("After deletion:", my_list)  # Output: After deletion: [1, 2, 4]

# Using pop() method
popped_element = my_list.pop()
print("Popped element:", popped_element)
print("After deletion:", my_list)  # Output: Popped element: 4 | After deletion: [1, 2]
```
### Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've covered searching, insertion, and deletion in lists in Python. These operations are essential for manipulating lists and are commonly used in various programming tasks.
