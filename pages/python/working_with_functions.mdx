# Working with Functions and Modules in Python

In this tutorial, we'll cover functions and modules in Python, including function structure, basic function calls, argument types, variable scope, and mutability/immutability of arguments.

## Function Structure

A function in Python is defined using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name and parameters enclosed in parentheses. Here's an example:

```python
def greet(name):
    print("Hello,", name)
```
### Basic Function Calls
You can call a function by using its name followed by parentheses containing the arguments. Here's how you call the greet function:

```python
greet("John")
```
### Argument Types
Python supports different types of function arguments, including positional arguments, keyword arguments, default arguments, and variable-length arguments. Here are examples of each:

```python
# Positional arguments
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

# Keyword arguments
def greet(name, greeting="Hello"):
    print(greeting, name)

# Default arguments
def power(x, n=2):
    return x ** n

# Variable-length arguments
def sum_all(*args):
    return sum(args)
```
### Variable Scope
Variables in Python have a scope, which determines their accessibility. There are two types of variable scopes: global scope and local scope. Here's an example:

```python
x = 10  # Global variable

def func():
    y = 20  # Local variable
    print(x)  # Access global variable
    print(y)  # Access local variable

func()
```
### Mutability/Immutability of Arguments
In Python, some data types are mutable (can be modified) and some are immutable (cannot be modified). Understanding mutability is important when working with function arguments. Here's an example:

```python
def modify_list(my_list):
    my_list.append(4)  # Modifying a mutable argument

my_list = [1, 2, 3]
modify_list(my_list)
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```
### Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've covered functions and modules in Python, including function structure, basic function calls, argument types, variable scope, and mutability/immutability of arguments. You should now have a good understanding of how to define and use functions in Python effectively.
