# Control Flow Statements in Python

In this tutorial, we'll cover control flow statements in Python, which allow you to control the flow of execution in your code.

## If-Else Statements

The if-else statement is used to execute a block of code based on a condition. Here's an example:

```python
x = 10

if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is not greater than 5")
```
### Loops (for and while)
Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly. Python supports two types of loops: `for` and  `while`. Here are examples of both:

### For Loop
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```
### While Loop
```python
count = 0

while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```
### Control Flow Keywords
Python provides control flow keywords like `break` and `continue` to modify the behavior of loops.

### Break
The `break` keyword is used to exit a loop prematurely. Here's an example:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
    if fruit == "banana":
        break
    print(fruit)
```
### Continue
The continue keyword is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration. Here's an example:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
    if fruit == "banana":
        continue
    print(fruit)
```
### Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've covered control flow statements in Python, including if-else statements, loops (for and while), and control flow keywords (break, continue). You should now have a good understanding of how to control the flow of execution in your Python code.
