# Dictionaries and Sorting in Python

In this tutorial, we'll cover dictionaries and sorting in Python, including basic operations, manipulation, and common use cases.

## Dictionaries

A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique. Here's how you can work with dictionaries:

```python
# Define a dictionary
my_dict = {"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}

# Access values
print(my_dict["name"])  # Output: John

# Add new key-value pairs
my_dict["job"] = "Engineer"
print(my_dict)  # Output: {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York', 'job': 'Engineer'}

# Iterate through keys and values

for key, value in my_dict.items():
    print(key, ":", value)
```
### Sorting
Python provides built-in functions to sort lists and dictionaries. Here are examples of sorting:

##### Sorting Lists
```python
my_list = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6]

# Sort in ascending order
my_list.sort()
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9]

# Sort in descending order
my_list.sort(reverse=True)
print(my_list)  # Output: [9, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1]
```
##### Sorting Dictionaries
```python
my_dict = {"b": 2, "a": 1, "c": 3}

# Sort keys
sorted_keys = sorted(my_dict.keys())
print(sorted_keys)  # Output: ['a', 'b', 'c']

# Sort values
sorted_values = sorted(my_dict.values())
print(sorted_values)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]
```
### Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've covered dictionaries and sorting in Python, including basic operations, manipulation, and common use cases. You should now have a good understanding of how to work with dictionaries and sorting algorithms in Python.
