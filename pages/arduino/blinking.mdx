# Blinking an LED with Arduino

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to blink an LED using Arduino, a beginner-friendly electronics project.

## What You'll Need

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- LED (any color)
- Resistor (220-330 ohms)
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

## Circuit Diagram

Here's the circuit diagram for blinking an LED with Arduino:

```plaintext
Arduino Digital Pin 13 --> Resistor --> LED --> Ground
```
### Arduino Sketch
```arduino
void setup() {
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT); // Set digital pin 13 as output
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(13, HIGH); // Turn LED on
  delay(1000); // Wait for 1 second
  digitalWrite(13, LOW); // Turn LED off
  delay(1000); // Wait for 1 second
}
```
### Explanation
In the `setup()` function, we configure pin 13 as an output pin using `pinMode()`.
In the `loop()` function, we continuously turn the LED on and off with a delay of 1 second between each state change using `digitalWrite()` and `delay()` functions.
### Conclusion
Congratulations! You've successfully blinked an LED using Arduino. Experiment with different delay times and LED connections to customize your LED blinking experience.
