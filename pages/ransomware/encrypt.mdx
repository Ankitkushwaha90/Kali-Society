## Encrypting and Decrypting Files with Python
In this tutorial, we'll learn how to use Python to encrypt and decrypt files using the cryptography library. We'll create a simple script that encrypts files using the Fernet symmetric encryption method and then decrypts them back to their original form.

### Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You'll also need to install the cryptography library, which can be done using pip:

```bash
pip install cryptography
```
### Understanding the Script
Let's go through the script step by step to understand how it works:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import os
```
### from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
We start by importing the necessary modules. os module is used for interacting with the operating system, and Fernet class from the cryptography.fernet module is used for encryption and decryption.

```python
files = []

for file in os.listdir():
	if file == "voldemort.py" or file == "thekey.key" or file == "decrypt.py":
		continue
	if os.path.isfile(file):
		files.append(file)

print(files)
```
Next, we initialize an empty list files to store the names of files in the current directory (excluding certain files like "voldemort.py", "thekey.key", and "decrypt.py"). We then iterate over each file in the directory, check if it's a regular file, and if so, append its name to the files list.

```python
with open("thekey.key", "rb") as key:
	secretkey = key.read()
```
We open and read the contents of the file named `"thekey.key"`, which contains the secret key used for encryption and decryption.

```python
for file in files:
	with open(file, "rb") as thefile:
		contents = thefile.read()
	contents_decrypted = Fernet(secretkey).decrypt(contents)
	with open(file, "wb") as thefile:
		thefile.write(contents_decrypted)
```
For each file in the files list, we open it in binary read mode, read its contents, and then decrypt the contents using the Fernet symmetric encryption method and the secret key we obtained earlier. Finally, we write the decrypted contents back to the file in binary write mode.

### Conclusion
That's it! You've learned how to encrypt and decrypt files using Python and the cryptography library. Feel free to modify the script to suit your needs or integrate it into your projects.
