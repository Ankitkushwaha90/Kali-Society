# information gather from client to server using python code

- server code
```python 
import socket

# Server configuration
HOST = '127.0.0.1'  # Server's IP address
PORT = 12345        # Port to listen on

# Create a socket object
server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

# Bind the socket to the address
server_socket.bind((HOST, PORT))

# Listen for incoming connections
server_socket.listen()

print("Server is listening...")

# Accept a client connection
client_socket, client_address = server_socket.accept()
print(f"Connection from {client_address} established.")

# Receive data from the client
client_data = client_socket.recv(1024).decode()

# Print the received data
print(f"Data received from client: {client_data}")

# Close the connection
client_socket.close()

```

- client code 
```python 
import socket
import platform

# Function to gather system information
def gather_system_info():
    system_info = f"Operating System: {platform.platform()}\n"
    system_info += f"Machine: {platform.machine()}\n"
    system_info += f"Processor: {platform.processor()}\n"
    system_info += f"Python Version: {platform.python_version()}\n"
    return system_info

# Client configuration
SERVER_HOST = '127.0.0.1'  # Server's IP address
SERVER_PORT = 12345        # Port to connect to

# Create a socket object
client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

# Connect to the server
client_socket.connect((SERVER_HOST, SERVER_PORT))

# Gather system information
system_info = gather_system_info()

# Send system information to the server
client_socket.send(system_info.encode())

# Close the connection
client_socket.close()

```
