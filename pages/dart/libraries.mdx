# Dart Libraries: Using Built-in Libraries, Creating Custom Libraries, and Dependency Management with Pub

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to use built-in libraries, create and use custom libraries, and manage dependencies with Pub in Dart with examples.

## Using Built-in Libraries

Dart provides a rich set of built-in libraries for various tasks such as math operations, file I/O, and more.

### Importing Built-in Libraries

You can import a built-in library using the `import` keyword.

```dart
import 'dart:math';

void main() {
  var random = Random();
  print(random.nextInt(100)); // Output: A random number between 0 and 99
}
```

## Creating and Using Custom Libraries

You can create your own custom libraries to encapsulate and reuse code.

### Creating a Custom Library

1. Create a Dart file and define a library using the `library` keyword.
2. Export the necessary parts using the `export` keyword.

`lib/my_library.dart`
```dart
library my_library;

void greet(String name) {
  print('Hello, \$name!');
}
```

### Using a Custom Library

1. Import the custom library in another Dart file.

`main.dart`
```dart
import 'lib/my_library.dart';

void main() {
  greet('Alice'); // Output: Hello, Alice!
}
```

## Dependency Management with Pub

Pub is Dart's package manager, which helps you manage dependencies in your Dart projects.

### Adding Dependencies

1. Open the `pubspec.yaml` file and add the dependency under `dependencies`.

`pubspec.yaml`
```yaml
name: my_project
description: A new Dart project
version: 1.0.0

environment:
  sdk: '>=2.12.0 <3.0.0'

dependencies:
  http: ^0.13.3
```

2. Run `pub get` to install the dependencies.

### Using Packages

Import and use the package in your Dart code.

`main.dart`
```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

void main() async {
  var url = Uri.parse('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1');
  var response = await http.get(url);
  if (response.statusCode == 200) {
    print(response.body); // Output: JSON data from the API
  } else {
    print('Request failed with status: \${response.statusCode}.');
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you learned how to use built-in libraries, create and use custom libraries, and manage dependencies with Pub in Dart. These skills are essential for organizing and managing code efficiently in Dart projects.
