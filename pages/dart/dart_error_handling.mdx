# Dart Error Handling: Try-Catch Blocks and Throwing Exceptions

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to handle errors in Dart using try-catch blocks and how to throw exceptions with examples.

## Try-Catch Blocks

The try-catch block in Dart is used to handle exceptions that might occur during the execution of a program.

### Basic Try-Catch

You can catch exceptions using a try-catch block.

```dart
void main() {
  try {
    int result = 10 ~/ 0;
    print(result);
  } catch (e) {
    print('An error occurred: \$e');
  }
}
```

### Catching Specific Exceptions

You can catch specific exceptions by specifying the type of exception.

```dart
void main() {
  try {
    int result = 10 ~/ 0;
    print(result);
  } on IntegerDivisionByZeroException {
    print('Cannot divide by zero');
  }
}
```

### Finally Block

The `finally` block is used to execute code regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not.

```dart
void main() {
  try {
    int result = 10 ~/ 0;
    print(result);
  } catch (e) {
    print('An error occurred: \$e');
  } finally {
    print('This is the finally block');
  }
}
```

## Throwing Exceptions

You can throw exceptions using the `throw` keyword.

### Throwing a Basic Exception

```dart
void checkAge(int age) {
  if (age < 18) {
    throw Exception('Age must be 18 or older');
  }
}

void main() {
  try {
    checkAge(16);
  } catch (e) {
    print('Caught an exception: \$e');
  }
}
```

### Creating Custom Exceptions

You can create custom exceptions by extending the `Exception` class.

```dart
class AgeException implements Exception {
  String errorMessage() {
    return 'Age must be 18 or older';
  }
}

void checkAge(int age) {
  if (age < 18) {
    throw AgeException();
  }
}

void main() {
  try {
    checkAge(16);
  } catch (e) {
    print('Caught an exception: \${(e as AgeException).errorMessage()}');
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you learned how to handle errors in Dart using try-catch blocks and how to throw exceptions. Error handling is crucial for creating robust and reliable applications.
