# Conditional Statements in Bash Scripting

Conditional statements allow you to control the flow of your Bash scripts based on certain conditions. In this tutorial, we'll cover if statements, case statements, and conditional operators in Bash scripting.

## If Statements

If statements in Bash are used to execute a block of code based on a condition. Here's the basic syntax of an if statement:

```bash
if [ condition ]; then
    # code to execute if condition is true
fi
```
For example:

```bash
age=20

if [ "$age" -ge 18 ]; then
    echo "You are an adult."
fi
```
In the above example, the `-ge` operator checks if the variable `age` is greater than or equal to 18. If the condition is true, it prints "You are an adult."

### Case Statements
Case statements provide a way to perform multiple conditional checks in a more concise manner. Here's the basic syntax of a case statement:

```bash
case expression in
    pattern1)
        # code to execute if expression matches pattern1
        ;;
    pattern2)
        # code to execute if expression matches pattern2
        ;;
    *)
        # default code to execute if no patterns match
        ;;
esac
```
For example:

```bash
fruit="apple"

case $fruit in
    "apple")
        echo "It's an apple."
        ;;
    "banana")
        echo "It's a banana."
        ;;
    *)
        echo "Unknown fruit."
        ;;
esac
```
In the above example, the case statement checks the value of the variable `fruit` and executes the corresponding code block based on the matching pattern.

### Conditional Operators
Bash supports various conditional operators for comparing values and testing conditions. Some common operators include:

- `-eq`: equal to
- `-ne`: not equal to
- `-gt`: greater than
- `-lt`: less than
- `-ge`: greater than or equal to
- `-le`: less than or equal to
For example:

```bash
num1=10
num2=20

if [ "$num1" -eq "$num2" ]; then
    echo "The numbers are equal."
fi
```
In the above example, the `-eq` operator checks if `num1` is equal to `num2`.

### Conclusion
Conditional statements are powerful tools for controlling the flow of your Bash scripts based on certain conditions. By mastering if statements, case statements, and conditional operators, you'll be able to write more flexible and dynamic Bash scripts to handle various scenarios.
