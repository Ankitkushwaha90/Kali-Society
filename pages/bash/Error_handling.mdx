# Error Handling in Bash Scripting

Error handling is crucial in Bash scripting to ensure that scripts behave as expected and gracefully handle unexpected errors. In this tutorial, we'll cover handling errors in Bash scripts, understanding exit codes, and displaying error messages.

## Handling Errors in Bash Scripts

Bash provides mechanisms for detecting errors and reacting accordingly within scripts. One common approach is using conditional statements to check for errors and take appropriate actions.

```bash
if [ condition ]; then
    # Code to execute if condition is true
else
    # Code to handle errors
fi
```
For example:

```bash
if ! command; then
    echo "Error: Command failed"
    exit 1
fi
```
In the above example, if the command fails (returns a non-zero exit status), an error message is displayed, and the script exits with a non-zero exit code (1).

### Exit Codes
Exit codes are numerical values returned by executed commands to indicate success or failure. By convention, an exit code of 0 signifies success, while non-zero values indicate failure.

```bash
command

if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Error: Command failed"
    exit 1
fi
```
In the above example, `$?` contains the exit code of the last executed command. If it's non-zero, an error message is displayed, and the script exits with a non-zero exit code.

### Error Messages
Displaying informative error messages is essential for debugging and troubleshooting Bash scripts. You can use the echo command to print error messages to the standard error stream (stderr).

```bash
echo "Error: Something went wrong" >&2
```
In the above example, `>&2` redirects the output of `echo` to stderr instead of stdout.

### Conclusion
Error handling is a critical aspect of Bash scripting to ensure scripts function correctly and gracefully handle unexpected errors. By understanding how to handle errors, interpret exit codes, and display informative error messages, you'll be better equipped to write robust and reliable Bash scripts for various tasks.
