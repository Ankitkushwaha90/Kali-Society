# File Operations in Bash Scripting

File operations are common tasks in Bash scripting, allowing you to work with files and directories, manage file permissions, and perform various file manipulation commands. In this tutorial, we'll cover working with files and directories, file permissions, and file manipulation commands in Bash scripting.

## Working with Files and Directories

Bash provides several commands for working with files and directories, such as `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `mkdir`, and `rmdir`.

### Listing Files and Directories

```bash
ls                # List files and directories in the current directory
ls /path/to/dir   # List files and directories in a specific directory
ls -l             # List files and directories in long format (detailed)
ls -a             # List all files and directories, including hidden ones
```
### Creating and Removing Files and Directories
```bash
touch file.txt    # Create an empty file
mkdir directory   # Create a directory
rm file.txt       # Remove a file
rmdir directory   # Remove a directory (if empty)
```
## File Permissions
File permissions determine who can read, write, or execute a file. Bash provides commands like `chmod` and `chown` to manage file permissions.

### Changing File Permissions
```bash
chmod +x script.sh        # Add execute permission to a script
chmod -rwx file.txt       # Remove read, write, and execute permissions from a file
chmod 644 file.txt        # Set read and write permissions for the owner, and read-only for others
```
### File Manipulation Commands
Bash provides various commands for manipulating file contents and attributes, such as `cat`, `grep`, `sed`, and `awk`.

### Viewing File Contents
```bash
cat file.txt              # Display file contents
head file.txt             # Display the first few lines of a file
tail file.txt             # Display the last few lines of a file
```
### Searching and Replacing Text
```bash
grep "pattern" file.txt   # Search for a pattern in a file
sed 's/old/new/' file.txt # Replace text in a file
```
### Conclusion
File operations are essential in Bash scripting for managing files and directories, setting file permissions, and manipulating file contents. By mastering the commands and techniques covered in this tutorial, you'll be able to efficiently work with files and directories in your Bash scripts.
