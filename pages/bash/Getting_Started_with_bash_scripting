# Getting Started with Bash Scripting

In this tutorial, we'll cover the essential steps to get started with Bash scripting, including setting up your environment, writing your first Bash script, and running Bash scripts.

## Setting up Your Environment

Before you begin Bash scripting, ensure that you have a Unix/Linux environment available. Most Unix-like operating systems come with Bash installed by default. You can open a terminal or command prompt to access the Bash shell.

If you're using macOS or Linux, you can open a terminal application such as Terminal or iTerm. For Windows users, you can use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) or install a Bash shell through tools like Git Bash or Cygwin.

## Writing Your First Bash Script

Once you have access to a Bash shell, you can start writing Bash scripts using a text editor of your choice. Here's a simple "Hello, World!" script to get you started:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# This is a comment
echo "Hello, World!"
