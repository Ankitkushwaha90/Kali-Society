# Input and Output in Bash Scripting

Input and output operations are fundamental in Bash scripting for interacting with users, displaying information, and redirecting data streams. In this tutorial, we'll cover how to read user input, output data, and redirect input and output in Bash scripts.

## Reading User Input

Bash provides the `read` command to read input from the user. Here's how you can use it:

```bash
echo "Enter your name:"
read name
echo "Hello, $name!"
```
In the above example, the `read` command reads a line from the standard input (usually from the keyboard) and assigns it to the variable `name`. The user's input is then echoed back with a greeting message.

### Outputting Data
Bash provides several ways to output data to the standard output, such as `echo` and `printf` commands.

##### Using echo
The echo command is used to print messages or variables to the standard output.

```bash
echo "Hello, World!"
```
### Using printf

The `printf` command allows for more complex formatting and control over the output.

```bash
printf "Hello, %s!\n" "World"
```
In the above example, `%s` is a placeholder for a string argument.

### Redirecting Input and Output
Bash allows you to redirect input and output using redirection operators.

##### Redirecting Output
The `>` operator is used to redirect the output of a command to a file. For example:

```bash
echo "Hello, World!" > output.txt
```
This command redirects the output of `echo` to a file named `output.txt`.

### Redirecting Input
The `<` operator is used to redirect `input` from a file to a command. For example:

```bash
cat < input.txt
```
This command reads the contents of `input.txt` and passes them as input to the `cat` command.

### Redirecting Output of a Command to Another Command
The `|` (pipe) operator is used to redirect the output of one command to the input of another command. For example:

```bash
ls | grep ".txt"
```
This command lists files in the current directory and passes the output to `grep` to filter files with a `.txt` extension.

### Conclusion
Input and output operations are essential for interacting with users, displaying information, and processing data in Bash scripts. By mastering the techniques covered in this tutorial, you'll be able to efficiently handle input and output streams in your Bash scripts.
