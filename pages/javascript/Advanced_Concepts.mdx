# Advanced JavaScript Concepts: Prototypal Inheritance, Functional Programming, and Design Patterns

In this tutorial, we'll dive into advanced JavaScript concepts that will enhance your understanding of the language and empower you to write more efficient and maintainable code. We'll cover prototypal inheritance, functional programming concepts like immutability and higher-order functions, and design patterns including singleton, factory, and module patterns.

## Prototypal Inheritance and Object Prototypes

JavaScript uses prototypal inheritance, where objects inherit properties and methods from other objects. Each object has a prototype chain, allowing for easy sharing of behavior between objects.

### Example:

```javascript
// Constructor function
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}

// Adding a method to the prototype
Person.prototype.sayHello = function() {
  return \`Hello, my name is \${this.name} and I'm \${this.age} years old.\`;
};

// Creating instances
const john = new Person('John', 30);
const jane = new Person('Jane', 25);

console.log(john.sayHello()); // Output: Hello, my name is John and I'm 30 years old.
console.log(jane.sayHello()); // Output: Hello, my name is Jane and I'm 25 years old.
```

## Functional Programming Concepts

Functional programming is a paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. Key concepts include immutability and higher-order functions.

### Immutability

Immutability refers to the idea that once an object is created, it cannot be changed. This leads to safer code and easier debugging.

### Higher-Order Functions

Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions. They enable code reuse and abstraction.

## Design Patterns in JavaScript

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. In JavaScript, popular design patterns include singleton, factory, and module patterns.

### Singleton Pattern

The singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

### Factory Pattern

The factory pattern creates objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.

### Module Pattern

The module pattern allows for encapsulation and organization of code by creating private and public methods and variables.
