# JavaScript Arrays and Objects Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will cover the basics of working with arrays and objects in JavaScript, along with common array methods like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.

## Arrays

### Creating Arrays

Arrays in JavaScript can be created using square brackets `[]`. For example:

```javascript
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```
### Accessing Array Elements
You can access elements of an array using square bracket notation and the index of the element. Remember, array indices start from 0. For example:

```javascript
console.log(numbers[0]); // Output: 1
```

## Array Methods
### Map
The map method creates a new array by applying a function to each element in the original array. For example:

```javascript
let doubled = numbers.map(num => num * 2);
console.log(doubled); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```
### Filter
The `filter` method creates a new array with elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function. For example:

```javascript
let evenNumbers = numbers.filter(num => num % 2 === 0);
console.log(evenNumbers); // Output: [2, 4]
```
### Reduce
The `reduce` method applies a function against an accumulator and each element in the array (from left to right) to reduce it to a single value. For example:

```javascript
let sum = numbers.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0);
console.log(sum); // Output: 15
``` 

## Objects
### Creating Objects
Objects in JavaScript are key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces `{}`. For example:

```javascript
let person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  city: "New York"
};
```
### Accessing Object Properties
You can access object properties using dot notation or square bracket notation. For example:

```javascript
console.log(person.name); // Output: John
console.log(person["age"]); // Output: 30
```
### Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've covered the basics of arrays, array methods, objects, and how to work with them in JavaScript. Practice these concepts to become proficient in JavaScript programming.
