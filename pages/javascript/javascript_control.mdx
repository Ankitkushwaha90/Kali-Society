# JavaScript Control Flow

JavaScript control flow statements allow you to control the flow of execution based on certain conditions. In this section, we'll cover conditional statements, loops, and truthy/falsy values in JavaScript.

## Conditional Statements

Conditional statements allow you to execute different blocks of code based on specified conditions. The most common conditional statements in JavaScript are `if-else` and `switch-case`.

### `if-else` Statement

The `if-else` statement allows you to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true, and another block of code if the condition is false.

```javascript
var age = 18;

if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You are an adult.");
} else {
  console.log("You are a minor.");
}
```
### switch-case Statement
The switch-case statement evaluates an expression and executes the code associated with the first matching case.

```javascript
var day = "Monday";

switch (day) {
  case "Monday":
    console.log("It's Monday.");
    break;
  case "Tuesday":
    console.log("It's Tuesday.");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("It's another day.");
}
```
### Loops
Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a specified condition is met. JavaScript supports for, while, and do-while loops.

### for Loop
The for loop repeats a block of code a specified number of times.

```javascript
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log("Iteration " + i);
}
```
### while Loop
The while loop repeats a block of code while a specified condition is true.

```javascript
var i = 0;

while (i < 5) {
  console.log("Iteration " + i);
  i++;
}
```
### do-while Loop
The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, except that it always executes the block of code at least once before checking the condition.

```javascript
var i = 0;

do {
  console.log("Iteration " + i);
  i++;
} while (i < 5);
```
### Truthy and Falsy Values
In JavaScript, values are inherently truthy or falsy based on their "truthiness". Truthy values are those that are considered true when evaluated in a Boolean context, while falsy values are considered false.

```javascript
var truthyValue = "Hello"; // Truthy
var falsyValue = 0; // Falsy
```
Understanding JavaScript control flow statements, including conditional statements, loops, and truthy/falsy values, is essential for writing flexible and efficient JavaScript code.
