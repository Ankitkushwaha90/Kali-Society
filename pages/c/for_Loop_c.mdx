# C Programming Tutorial: The for Loop

In this tutorial, we'll explore the `for` loop in C programming. The `for` loop is used to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a specified condition. It's particularly useful when you know the number of iterations beforehand.

## Syntax

The syntax of the `for` loop in C is as follows:

```c
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
    // Code to be executed
}
```
- initialization: Initializes the loop control variable.
- condition: Evaluates to true or false. If true, the loop continues; if false, the loop terminates.
- increment/decrement: Modifies the loop control variable to control the loop's execution.

### Example
Let's look at an example of a for loop that prints numbers from 1 to 5:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int i;
    for (i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
        printf("%d ", i);
    }
    return 0;
}
```
- Output:
```
1 2 3 4 5
```
In this example:

- i is initialized to 1.
- The loop continues as long as i is less than or equal to 5.
- After each iteration, i is incremented by 1.

### Nested for Loops
You can also nest for loops inside each other to create complex iteration patterns. For example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int i, j;
    for (i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
        for (j = 1; j <= 3; j++) {
            printf("(%d, %d) ", i, j);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```
- Output:

```scss
(1, 1) (1, 2) (1, 3)
(2, 1) (2, 2) (2, 3)
(3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 3)
```
In this example, we have a nested for loop where the outer loop runs 3 times and the inner loop runs 3 times for each iteration of the outer loop.

### Conclusion
The for loop is a powerful construct in C programming for executing a block of code repeatedly. With its flexible syntax and ability to control iteration, it's an essential tool for many programming tasks.
