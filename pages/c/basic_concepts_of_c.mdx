# Basic Concepts of C Programming

In this tutorial, we'll cover the basic concepts of C programming, which form the foundation for writing C programs. By understanding these concepts, you'll be able to create simple yet powerful applications in C.

## Structure of a C Program

A C program consists of various elements such as functions, variables, and statements. Here's the basic structure of a C program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Function prototypes
int main() {
    // Statements
    return 0;
}
```
- `#include <stdio.h>`: This line includes the standard input/output library, which provides functions like `printf()` and `scanf()` for input and output operations.
- `int main() { ... }`: Every C program must contain a `main()` function, which serves as the entry point for the program. The program execution begins from the `main()` function.
- `// Statements`: This section contains statements that define the behavior of the program. Statements can include variable declarations, function calls, control flow statements, and more.
- `return 0;`: The `return` statement is used to exit the `main()` function and return a value to the operating system. A return value of 0 typically indicates successful execution of the program.
### Variables and Data Types
Variables are used to store data in a C program. Each variable has a data type that determines the type of data it can hold. Common data types in C include `int`, `float`, `char`, `double`, and `void`. Here's how you declare variables in C:

```c
int age = 30;
float salary = 2500.50;
char grade = 'A';
```
### Constants
Constants are fixed values that do not change during the execution of a program. In C, constants can be defined using the const keyword or preprocessor #define directive. Here are examples of constants in C:

```c
const int MAX_SIZE = 100;
#define PI 3.14
```
### Operators
Operators are symbols that perform operations on operands. C supports various types of operators, including arithmetic, relational, logical, assignment, and bitwise operators. Here are some examples of operators in C:

```c
int sum = 10 + 5;       // Addition
int difference = 10 - 5; // Subtraction
int product = 10 * 5;    // Multiplication
int quotient = 10 / 5;   // Division
int remainder = 10 % 5;  // Modulus
```
### Input and Output Functions
Input and output functions are used to interact with the user and display information on the screen. The `printf()` function is used to display output, while the `scanf()` function is used to read input from the user. Here's how you use these functions in C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num;
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &num);
    printf("You entered: %d", num);
    return 0;
}
```
By mastering these basic concepts, you'll have a solid understanding of the fundamentals of C programming. In the next tutorials, we'll delve deeper into control flow statements, functions, arrays, pointers, and more.
