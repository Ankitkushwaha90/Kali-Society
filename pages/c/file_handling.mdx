# C Programming Tutorial: File Handling

In this tutorial, we'll explore file handling in C programming. File handling allows us to read data from files, write data to files, and perform various operations on files.

## File Pointers

In C programming, file handling is performed using file pointers. A file pointer is a variable that stores the address of the file being accessed.

To work with files in C, you need to include the `<stdio.h>` header file, which contains functions and macros for file handling.

## Opening a File

To open a file in C, you can use the `fopen()` function. The syntax is:

```c
FILE *fptr;
fptr = fopen("filename", "mode");
```
- `filename`: The name of the file to be opened.
- `mode`: The mode in which the file should be opened (e.g., "r" for reading, "w" for writing, "a" for appending).
### Reading from a File
To read from a file in C, you can use functions like fscanf() or fgets(). Here's an example using fscanf() to read integers from a file:

```c
FILE *fptr;
int num;
fptr = fopen("data.txt", "r");
if (fptr == NULL) {
    printf("File does not exist.");
} else {
    while (fscanf(fptr, "%d", &num) != EOF) {
        printf("%d ", num);
    }
    fclose(fptr);
}
```
### Writing to a File
To write to a file in C, you can use functions like `fprintf()` or `fputs()`. Here's an example using `fprintf()` to write integers to a file:

```c
FILE *fptr;
int num;
fptr = fopen("output.txt", "w");
if (fptr == NULL) {
    printf("File creation failed.");
} else {
    for (num = 1; num <= 5; num++) {
        fprintf(fptr, "%d\n", num);
    }
    fclose(fptr);
}
```
Closing a File
After performing file operations, it's essential to close the file using the fclose() function to release system resources. The syntax is:

```c
fclose(fptr);
```
### Conclusion
File handling is an essential aspect of C programming, allowing you to work with external files for reading, writing, and other operations. Understanding file handling operations is crucial for many real-world applications.
