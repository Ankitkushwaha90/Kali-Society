# File Handling in C Programming

File handling is an essential aspect of programming, allowing you to read data from files, write data to files, and perform various operations on files. In C programming, file handling is done using file pointers and a set of standard library functions. In this tutorial, we'll cover the basics of file handling and common file operations.

## Introduction to File Handling

File handling in C involves working with files on the disk, performing operations such as reading from and writing to files. Files are typically stored on secondary storage devices such as hard drives and can be of various types, such as text files and binary files.

## Opening and Closing Files

To perform operations on a file in C, you first need to open the file using the `fopen()` function and obtain a file pointer. Once you're done with the file, you should close it using the `fclose()` function to release the associated resources. Here's how you open and close a file in C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    FILE *filePtr;

    // Open file for reading
    filePtr = fopen("example.txt", "r");
    if (filePtr == NULL) {
        printf("Unable to open file.");
        return 1;
    }

    // File operations go here

    // Close the file
    fclose(filePtr);
    return 0;
}
```
In this example, we've opened a file named "example.txt" for reading using the "r" mode. If the file cannot be opened, an error message is displayed, and the program exits.

### Reading from and Writing to Files
Once a file is opened, you can perform various operations such as reading data from the file using functions like `fscanf()` and `fgets()`, and writing data to the file using functions like `fprintf()` and `fputs()`. Here's an example of reading from and writing to a file:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    FILE *filePtr;
    char buffer[255];

    // Open file for writing
    filePtr = fopen("example.txt", "w");
    if (filePtr == NULL) {
        printf("Unable to open file.");
        return 1;
    }

    // Write data to the file
    fprintf(filePtr, "Hello, World!\n");

    // Close the file
    fclose(filePtr);

    // Open file for reading
    filePtr = fopen("example.txt", "r");
    if (filePtr == NULL) {
        printf("Unable to open file.");
        return 1;
    }

    // Read data from the file
    fgets(buffer, 255, filePtr);
    printf("Data read from file: %s", buffer);

    // Close the file
    fclose(filePtr);
    return 0;
}
```
In this example, we've opened a file named "example.txt" for writing using the `"w"` mode, written data to the file using `fprintf()`, closed the file, reopened it for reading, read data from the file using `fgets()`, and printed the data to the console.

### Error Handling in File Operations
Error handling is an important aspect of file handling to ensure that your program behaves correctly in case of errors such as file not found or permission denied. You can use conditional statements and error-checking functions to handle errors gracefully. Here's an example of error handling in file operations:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    FILE *filePtr;

    // Open file for reading
    filePtr = fopen("example.txt", "r");
    if (filePtr == NULL) {
        printf("Unable to open file.");
        return 1;
    }

    // File operations go here

    // Close the file
    fclose(filePtr);
    return 0;
}
```
In this example, if the file "example.txt" cannot be opened for reading, an error message is displayed, and the program exits with an error code.

By mastering file handling in C programming, you'll be able to work with files effectively, enabling your programs to read and write data from and to files. In the next tutorials, we'll explore more advanced topics such as dynamic memory allocation, advanced data structures, and error handling.
