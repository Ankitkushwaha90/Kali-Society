# Tutorial:Minimum Votes Required for Nominee

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll discuss a C program to calculate the minimum number of votes required for a nominee to win an election, given the number of nominees and voters.

## Key Concepts

- **Test Cases (T)**: The program takes an integer T representing the number of test cases.
- **Nominees (N) and Voters (M)**: For each test case, the program takes two integers N and M, where N is the number of nominees and M is the number of voters.
- **Minimum Votes Required**: The program calculates the minimum number of votes required for a nominee to win based on the number of voters.

## Code Explanation

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int T; // Number of test cases
    scanf("%d", &T);

    while (T--) {
        int N, M; // Number of nominees and number of voters
        scanf("%d %d", &N, &M);

        int min_votes_required;
        if (M % 2 == 0) {
            min_votes_required = M / 2 + 1;
        } else {
            min_votes_required = (M + 1) / 2;
        }

        printf("%d\n", min_votes_required);
    }

    return 0;
}
```
### Algorithm Explanation
- 1.Input: Read the number of test cases (T) from the standard input.
- 2.For Each Test Case:
    -Read the number of nominees (N) and the number of voters (M) from the standard input.
    -Calculate the minimum votes required for a nominee to win:
    -If the number of voters (M) is even, the minimum votes required is (M / 2) + 1.
    -If the number of voters (M) is odd, the minimum votes required is ((M + 1) / 2).
  -3 .Output: Print the minimum votes required for each test case.
Example
Suppose we have 2 test cases:

- Test Case 1: N = 3 nominees, M = 5 voters.
- Test Case 2: N = 4 nominees, M = 6 voters.
For Test Case 1:

- Number of voters is odd (M = 5).
- Minimum votes required = (5 + 1) / 2 = 3 votes.
For Test Case 2:

- Number of voters is even (M = 6).
- Minimum votes required = 6 / 2 + 1 = 4 votes.
### Conclusion
This C program efficiently calculates the minimum number of votes required for a nominee to win an election based on the number of voters and nominees. Understanding this algorithm can be useful in designing fair voting systems and analyzing election outcomes.
