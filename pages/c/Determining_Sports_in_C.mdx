# Determining Sports Section Page

In this tutorial, we'll create a simple program in C to determine if a given page number is dedicated to the sports section of a newspaper.

## Overview

We'll write a C program that takes an input page number and checks if it's dedicated to the sports section based on a given condition.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following:

- Basic understanding of C programming language
- Compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)
- Terminal or Command Prompt

## Steps

### Step 1: Writing the C Code

Create a new C file (e.g., `sports_section.c`) and write the following code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int page_number;

    // Input the page number
    printf("Enter the page number: ");
    scanf("%d", &page_number);

    // Check if the page number is dedicated to the sports section
    if (page_number >= 8) {
        printf("YES\n");
    } else {
        printf("NO\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```
### Step 2: Understanding the Code
- We declare an integer variable page_number to store the input page number.
- We prompt the user to input the page number using printf and read the input using scanf.
- We use an if statement to check if the page number is greater than or equal to 8, which indicates that it's dedicated to the sports section.
- Depending on the condition, we print either "YES" or "NO" to indicate whether the page is dedicated to the sports section.
### Step 3: Compiling and Running the Program
Compile the C program using a C compiler (e.g., GCC) and run the executable:

```bash
gcc sports_section.c -o sports_section
./sports_section
```
Enter a page number when prompted, and the program will output whether it's dedicated to the sports section or not.

### Conclusion
Congratulations! You've created a simple C program to determine if a given page number is dedicated to the sports section of a newspaper. Feel free to further customize and expand it based on your requirements.
