# C Programming Tutorial: The do-while Loop

In this tutorial, we'll explore the `do-while` loop in C programming. The `do-while` loop is similar to the `while` loop, but it guarantees that the block of code is executed at least once before checking the loop condition.

## Syntax

The syntax of the `do-while` loop in C is as follows:

```c
do {
    // Code to be executed
} while (condition);
```
- `condition`: An expression evaluated after each iteration. If true, the loop continues; if false, the loop terminates.
### Example
Let's look at an example of a do-while loop that prints numbers from 1 to 5:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int i = 1;
    do {
        printf("%d ", i);
        i++;
    } while (i <= 5);
    return 0;
}
```

- Output:
```bash
1 2 3 4 5
```
In this example:

- We initialize the loop control variable i to 1.
- Inside the loop, we print the value of i and then increment i by 1.
- The loop continues as long as i is less than or equal to 5.
### Difference from the while Loop
The key difference between the do-while loop and the while loop is that the do-while loop executes its body at least once, even if the condition is initially false. This makes it suitable for situations where you want the loop body to run at least once.

### Example Use Case
A common use case for the do-while loop is input validation. For example, prompting the user to enter a positive number:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num;
    do {
        printf("Enter a positive number: ");
        scanf("%d", &num);
    } while (num <= 0);
    printf("You entered: %d", num);
    return 0;
}
```
In this example, the loop ensures that the user enters a positive number before proceeding.

### Conclusion
The do-while loop is a useful control structure in C programming for executing code repeatedly with guaranteed initial execution. It provides flexibility and is commonly used in various programming scenarios.
