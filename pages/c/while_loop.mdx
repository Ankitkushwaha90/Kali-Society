# C Programming Tutorial: The while Loop

In this tutorial, we'll explore the `while` loop in C programming. The `while` loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

## Syntax

The syntax of the `while` loop in C is as follows:

```c
while (condition) {
    // Code to be executed
}
```
- `condition`: An expression evaluated before each iteration. If true, the loop continues; if false, the loop terminates.
### Example
Let's look at an example of a while loop that prints numbers from 1 to 5:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int i = 1;
    while (i <= 5) {
        printf("%d ", i);
        i++;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
Output:
```bash
1 2 3 4 5
```
In this example:

- We initialize the loop control variable i to 1.
- The loop continues as long as i is less than or equal to 5.
- Inside the loop, we print the value of i and then increment i by 1.
### Infinite Loops
- Be cautious when using `while` loops to avoid infinite loops, where the loop condition never becomes false. For example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int i = 1;
    while (i <= 5) {
        printf("%d ", i);
    }
    return 0;
}
```
In this example, the loop will run indefinitely because the value of i is never incremented, and the loop condition never becomes false.

### Conclusion
The while loop is a fundamental control structure in C programming for executing code repeatedly based on a condition. It provides flexibility and is commonly used in various programming tasks.
