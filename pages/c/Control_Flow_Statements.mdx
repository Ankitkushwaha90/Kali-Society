# Control Flow Statements in C

Control flow statements in C allow you to control the flow of execution based on certain conditions or loops. In this tutorial, we'll cover decision-making structures and loops in C programming.

## Decision Making with if-else Statements

The `if-else` statement is used to make decisions in C programming based on the evaluation of a condition. Here's the syntax of the `if-else` statement:

```c
if (condition) {
    // code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
    // code to be executed if the condition is false
}
```
### Nested if-else Statements
You can nest `if-else` statements within each other to create complex decision-making logic. Here's an example of nested `if-else` statements:

```c
int num = 10;
if (num > 0) {
    if (num % 2 == 0) {
        printf("The number is positive and even.");
    } else {
        printf("The number is positive and odd.");
    }
} else {
    printf("The number is negative.");
}
```
### Switch Case Statements
The `switch-case` statement is used to select one of many code blocks to be executed based on the value of an expression. Here's the syntax of the `switch-case` statement:

```c
switch (expression) {
    case value1:
        // code to be executed if expression equals value1
        break;
    case value2:
        // code to be executed if expression equals value2
        break;
    // more cases...
    default:
        // code to be executed if expression doesn't match any case
}
```
### Loops: while, do-while, for
Loops in C programming are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met. C supports three types of loops: `while`, `do-while`, and `for` loops.

- `while loop`: Executes a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true.
- `do-while loop`: Similar to the `while` loop, but the condition is evaluated after the block of code is executed, ensuring that the block is executed at least once.
- `for loop`: Executes a block of code a specified number of times.
### Break and Continue Statements
- The `break` statement is used to exit the current loop or switch-case statement and transfer control to the statement following the terminated loop or switch-case.
- The `continue` statement is used to skip the remaining code inside a loop and proceed to the next iteration of the loop.
By mastering control flow statements in C, you'll have better control over the flow of execution in your programs. In the next tutorials, we'll explore functions, arrays, pointers, and more.
