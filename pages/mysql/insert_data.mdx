# MySQL Insert Data into Tables: Step-by-Step Guide

## Introduction

Inserting data into tables is a fundamental aspect of MySQL database management. In this tutorial, you will learn how to insert data into MySQL tables using the basic SQL syntax.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A MySQL database server installed and configured
- Access to a MySQL user account with permissions to insert data into tables
- Basic knowledge of SQL syntax

## Step 1: Connect to MySQL Server

Before inserting data, connect to your MySQL server using the MySQL command-line client or a MySQL GUI tool.

```mdx
mysql -u username -p
```
Replace `username` with your MySQL user account username, and you will be prompted to enter the password.

### Step 2: Choose Database and Table
Decide which database and table you want to insert data into. If you haven't already created a table, refer to the previous tutorial on creating tables.

```mdx
USE database_name;
```
### Step 3: Insert Single Row
To insert data into a table, use the `INSERT INTO` statement followed by the table name and values to be inserted.

```mdx
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);
```
Replace `table_name` with the name of your table and provide values for each column in the same order as specified in the INSERT INTO statement.

### Step 4: Insert Multiple Rows
You can insert multiple rows at once by providing multiple sets of values.

```mdx
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
VALUES
    (value1_1, value1_2, value1_3, ...),
    (value2_1, value2_2, value2_3, ...),
    ...
;
```
### Step 5: Verify Data Insertion
After inserting data, you can verify its insertion by querying the table.

```mdx

SELECT * FROM table_name;
```
### Conclusion
Congratulations! You have successfully inserted data into MySQL tables. You can now start manipulating and querying the data in your MySQL database.

Continue learning and exploring more advanced SQL operations to enhance your database management skills.
