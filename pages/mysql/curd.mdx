# MySQL CRUD Operations: Step-by-Step Guide

### Introduction

CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations are fundamental to managing data in MySQL databases. In this tutorial, you will learn how to perform basic CRUD operations on MySQL tables using SQL commands.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A MySQL database server installed and configured
- Access to a MySQL user account with appropriate permissions to execute CRUD operations
- Basic knowledge of SQL syntax

### Step 1: Create Table

Before performing CRUD operations, you need to have a table in your database. If you haven't already created one, refer to the tutorial on creating tables.

### Step 2: Insert Data

Use the `INSERT INTO` statement to add new records to your table.

```mdx
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);
```
### Step 3: Read Data
Retrieve data from your table using the `SELECT` statement.

```mdx
SELECT * FROM table_name;
``` 
### Step 4: Update Data
Modify existing records in your table using the `UPDATE` statement.

```mdx
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = new_value1, column2 = new_value2
WHERE condition;
```
### Step 5: Delete Data
Remove records from your table using the `DELETE` statement.

```mdx
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```
### Conclusion
Congratulations! You have learned how to perform basic CRUD operations on MySQL tables. With CRUD operations, you can manage data effectively in your MySQL databases, enabling you to create, read, update, and delete records as needed.
