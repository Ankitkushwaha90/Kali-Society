Creating a website using Flask involves setting up routes for different pages, rendering HTML templates, and serving static files. Below is a simple example of how to create a basic website with Flask:

Install Flask:
If you haven't already, install Flask using pip:

Copy code
pip install flask
Create a Flask application:
Create a Python file for your Flask application, e.g., app.py, and import Flask:

python
Copy code
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return 'Welcome to my website!'
Define routes:
Define routes for different pages of your website. Each route corresponds to a different URL. For example:

python
Copy code
@app.route('/about')
def about():
    return 'About page'

@app.route('/contact')
def contact():
    return 'Contact page'
Render HTML templates:
Flask uses Jinja2 templating engine for rendering HTML templates. Create a folder named templates in your project directory and put your HTML templates there. Here's how you can render an HTML template:

python
Copy code
from flask import render_template

@app.route('/blog')
def blog():
    return render_template('blog.html', title='My Blog', posts=[...])
Serve static files:
You can serve static files such as CSS, JavaScript, and images using Flask's static folder. Create a folder named static in your project directory and put your static files there. For example:

```python
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ url_for('static', filename='style.css') }}">
```
Run the Flask application:
At the bottom of your app.py file, add:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    //app.run(debug=True)
    app.run(host='127.0.0.1', port=5000)
```
Run your Flask application:
Open a terminal, navigate to the directory containing app.py, and run:

```cmd
python app.py
```
- 8. Access your website:
Open a web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (by default) to see your website.

Here's an example folder structure for your Flask project:

```arduino
project/
│
├── app.py
│
├── templates/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── about.html
│   ├── contact.html
│   └── blog.html
│
└── static/
    ├── style.css
    └── script.js
```
- This is a basic setup. You can expand and customize your website by adding more routes, templates, static files, and integrating with databases or other services as needed.
