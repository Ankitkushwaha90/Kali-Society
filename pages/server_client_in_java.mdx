-- Private Client and Server Communication: Java Tutorial

# Introduction
Welcome to the Private Client and Server Communication tutorial in Java! In this tutorial, we'll explore how to create a client-server communication system using Java, where the client communicates with the server using a private IP address. We'll discuss both the client and server code and provide a step-by-step explanation.

## Client Code
Java 
```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.io.PrintWriter;
import java.net.Socket;

public class PrivateClient {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String serverAddress = "192.168.77.28"; // Private IP address of the server
        int serverPort = 8000;

        try {
            // Connect to the server
            Socket socket = new Socket(serverAddress, serverPort);

            // Open input and output streams for communication with the server
            BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));
            PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), true);

            // Send data to the server
            out.println("Hello from the client!");

            // Read the server's response
            String response = in.readLine();
            System.out.println("Server response: " + response);

            // Close streams and socket
            in.close();
            out.close();
            socket.close();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```
## Server Code
Java 
```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.io.PrintWriter;
import java.net.ServerSocket;
import java.net.Socket;

public class PrivateServer {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int port = 8000;

        try {
            // Create a server socket bound to a private IP address and port
            ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(port);
            System.out.println("Server started on port " + port);

            // Listen for incoming connections
            while (true) {
                Socket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept(); // Accept connection from client

                // Open input and output streams for communication with the client
                BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(clientSocket.getInputStream()));
                PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(clientSocket.getOutputStream(), true);

                // Read data from the client and echo it back
                String inputLine;
                if ((inputLine = in.readLine()) != null) {
                    System.out.println("Received from client: " + inputLine);
                    out.println("Server received: " + inputLine); // Echo the received data back to the client
                }

                // Close streams and socket
                in.close();
                out.close();
                clientSocket.close();
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```
## Tutorial Overview
In this tutorial, we have two main components:

- Client: The client code establishes a connection to the server using a private IP address and sends a message to the server.
- Server: The server code listens for incoming connections from clients, receives messages from clients, and echoes them back to the clients.
This tutorial provides a foundational understanding of how to create a simple client-server communication system using Java, suitable for various networking applications.
