-- Java Variables: Global and Local

# Introduction
Welcome to the Java Variables tutorial! Variables are essential components of any programming language, including Java. In Java, variables can be classified into global variables (also known as instance variables or fields) and local variables. Understanding the differences between these two types of variables is crucial for writing effective and maintainable Java code. Let's explore global and local variables in Java in detail.

## Global Variables (Instance Variables)
Global variables, also known as instance variables or fields, are declared within a class but outside of any method, constructor, or block. They are accessible to all methods within the class and can also be accessed by methods from other classes, depending on their access modifiers (public, private, protected, or default). Here's an example of declaring and accessing global variables in Java:

```java
public class MyClass {
    // Global variables
    int globalVar1; // default access modifier
    public int globalVar2; // public access modifier
    private int globalVar3; // private access modifier

    // Constructor
    public MyClass(int val) {
        globalVar3 = val;
    }

    // Method to access global variable
    public void displayGlobalVar() {
        System.out.println("Global variable 1: " + globalVar1);
        System.out.println("Global variable 2: " + globalVar2);
        System.out.println("Global variable 3: " + globalVar3);
    }
}
```

In the above example, `num1`, `num2`, `sum`, and `message` are local variables within their respective methods.

## Key Differences
Here are the key differences between global and local variables in Java:

- Scope: Global variables have class-level scope, while local variables have method-level scope.
- Lifetime: Global variables exist as long as the object of the class exists, whereas local variables exist only within the scope in which they are declared and are destroyed once the scope is exited.
- Access Control: Global variables can be accessed by all methods within the class (depending on their access modifiers), while local variables are only accessible within the method/block in which they are declared.
Best Practices
When using variables in Java, consider the following best practices:

Use global variables sparingly and prefer encapsulation by making them private and providing public accessor methods (getters and setters).
Always initialize local variables before using them to avoid compilation errors.
Minimize the scope of variables by declaring them in the smallest possible scope where they are needed.
