### Data Types and Variables in Java
# Module 2: Data Types and Variables

In Java, data types represent the type of data that can be stored in a variable. Variables are used to store data values that can be manipulated and used in your Java programs. In this module, we'll cover primitive data types, declaring variables, constants, and type casting in Java.

## Primitive Data Types

Java has eight primitive data types, which are the most basic data types available in the language. They are:

1. **byte:** 8-bit signed integer
2. **short:** 16-bit signed integer
3. **int:** 32-bit signed integer
4. **long:** 64-bit signed integer
5. **float:** 32-bit floating-point number
6. **double:** 64-bit floating-point number
7. **char:** 16-bit Unicode character
8. **boolean:** Represents true or false

Example:

```java
int age = 30;
double salary = 50000.50;
char grade = 'A';
boolean isStudent = true;
```
### Declaring Variables
Variables in Java must be declared before they can be used. The syntax for declaring variables is as follows:

```java
dataType variableName;
```
Example:

```java
int number;
double price;
char letter;
```
You can also initialize variables when declaring them:

```java
int count = 10;
double weight = 68.5;
char symbol = 'X';
```
### Constants
Constants are variables whose values cannot be changed once assigned. In Java, constants are declared using the `final` keyword. By convention, constant names are written in uppercase.

```java
final double PI = 3.14159;
final int MAX_SIZE = 100;
final String APP_NAME = "MyApp";
```
### Type Casting
Type casting is the process of converting one data type into another. In Java, there are two types of casting: implicit casting (widening) and explicit casting (narrowing).

- Implicit Casting: Java automatically converts smaller data types to larger data types without any loss of data.
```java
int num1 = 10;
double num2 = num1; // implicit casting
```
- Explicit Casting: When you convert a larger data type to a smaller data type, you need to use explicit casting. However, explicit casting may result in loss of data.
```java
double num1 = 10.5;
int num2 = (int) num1; // explicit casting
```
That's it for this module on data types and variables in Java! In the next module, we'll dive deeper into operators and expressions.
