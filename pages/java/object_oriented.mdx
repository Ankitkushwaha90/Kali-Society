# Object-Oriented Programming in Java

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can contain data in the form of fields and code in the form of methods. Java is a powerful object-oriented programming language that supports various OOP concepts. In this tutorial, we'll cover the key OOP concepts in Java.

## Classes and Objects

In Java, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties (fields) and behaviors (methods) that objects of the class will have. Here's an example of a simple class and its instantiation:

```java
// Defining a class
public class Car {
    // Fields
    String make;
    String model;
    int year;

    // Method
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("The car is starting...");
    }
}

// Creating an object of the Car class
Car myCar = new Car();
```
```java 
// Defining the Car class
public class Car {
    // Fields
    String make;
    String model;
    int year;
 
    // Method
    public  void start() {
        System.out.println("The car is starting...");
    }

    // Main method to create an object and invoke start()
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an object of the Car class
        Car myCar = new Car();

        // Invoking the start() method
        myCar.start();
    }
}

```
### Constructors
A constructor is a special method used to initialize objects. It has the same name as the class and is invoked when an object of the class is created. Constructors can be used to set initial values for object fields.

```java
public class Car {
    String make;
    String model;
    int year;

    // Constructor
    public Car(String make, String model, int year) {
        this.make = make;
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
    }
}

// Creating an object of the Car class using a constructor
Car myCar = new Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2022);
```
```java
public class Car {
    String make;
    String model;
    int year;
 
    // Constructor
    public Car(String make, String model, int year) {
        this.make = make;
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
    }

    // Method to print car details
    public void printCarDetails() {
        System.out.println("Car Make: " + make);
        System.out.println("Car Model: " + model);
        System.out.println("Car Year: " + year);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args){
        // Creating an object of the Car class using a constructor
        Car myCar = new Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2022);
        
        // Printing the content of myCar
        myCar.printCarDetails();
    }
}
```
### Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the mechanism of wrapping data (fields) and methods within a single unit (class). It helps in hiding the internal state of an object and only exposing the necessary functionality.

```java
public class Car {
    private String make;
    private String model;
    private int year;

    // Getters and setters
    public String getMake() {
        return make;
    }

    public void setMake(String make) {
        this.make = make;
    }

    // Other methods...
}
```
### Inheritance
Inheritance is a mechanism in which a new class inherits properties and behaviors from an existing class. The existing class is called the superclass or parent class, and the new class is called the subclass or child class.

```java
// Parent class
public class Vehicle {
    // Fields and methods...
}

// Child class inheriting from Vehicle
public class Car extends Vehicle {
    // Additional fields and methods specific to Car...
}
```
### Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class. It enables the same method to behave differently based on the object that invokes it. Polymorphism is achieved through method overriding and method overloading.

```java
// Method overriding
public class Vehicle {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Vehicle is starting...");
    }
}

public class Car extends Vehicle {
    @Override
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Car is starting...");
    }
}

// Method overloading
public class Calculator {
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    public double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```
### Conclusion
Object-oriented programming is a powerful paradigm that allows you to model real-world entities in your software. By understanding the concepts of classes, objects, constructors, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, method overloading, and method overriding, you'll be able to design and implement robust Java applications.
