-- Java Loops: Global and Local Variables

# Introduction
Welcome to the Java Loops tutorial! Loops are fundamental constructs in programming that allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly. In Java, there are several types of loops, including `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to use loops in Java, along with understanding the concept of global and local variables within loops.

## Global and Local Variables
Before diving into loops, let's quickly review the concept of global and local variables in Java:

- **Global Variables**: Global variables are declared outside of any method, constructor, or block in a class. They are accessible to all methods within the class.
- **Local Variables**: Local variables are declared within a method, constructor, or block and are only accessible within that specific scope.

## Using Loops in Java
Java provides three types of loops:

### 1. `for` Loop
The `for` loop is used when you know the number of iterations in advance. It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement. Here's an example of a `for` loop with global and local variables:

```java
public class ForLoopExample {
    // Global variable
    static int globalVar = 0;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Local variable
        int localVar = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            globalVar += i;
            localVar += i;
        }
        
        System.out.println("Global variable: " + globalVar);
        System.out.println("Local variable: " + localVar);
    }
}
```
### 2. `while` Loop
The `while` loop is used when the number of iterations is not known in advance but is based on a condition. It continues to execute as long as the condition evaluates to true. Here's an example:
```java
public class WhileLoopExample {
    // Global variable
    static int globalVar = 0;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Local variable
        int localVar = 0;
        
        int i = 1;
        while (i <= 5) {
            globalVar += i;
            localVar += i;
            i++;
        }
        
        System.out.println("Global variable: " + globalVar);
        System.out.println("Local variable: " + localVar);
    }
}
```
### 3. `do-while` Loop
The `do-while` loop is similar to the while loop, but it executes the block of code at least once before checking the condition. Here's an example:

```java
public class DoWhileLoopExample {
    // Global variable
    static int globalVar = 0;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Local variable
        int localVar = 0;
        
        int i = 1;
        do {
            globalVar += i;
            localVar += i;
            i++;
        } while (i <= 5);
        
        System.out.println("Global variable: " + globalVar);
        System.out.println("Local variable: " + localVar);
    }
}
```
