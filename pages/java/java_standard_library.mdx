# Java Standard Library

The Java Standard Library, also known as the Java API (Application Programming Interface), is a collection of classes and interfaces that provide essential functionalities for Java programming. In this tutorial, we'll explore some key components of the Java Standard Library.

## String Handling

Strings are fundamental data types in Java, and the Java Standard Library provides extensive support for string manipulation. Some common operations include:

- Concatenation
- Substring extraction
- Searching and replacing
- Case conversion
- String formatting

```java
String str = "Hello, World!";
System.out.println(str.substring(0, 5)); // Output: Hello
System.out.println(str.toUpperCase()); // Output: HELLO, WORLD!
```
### Date and Time API
Java 8 introduced the Date and Time API, which provides comprehensive support for date and time manipulation. It includes classes like `LocalDate`, `LocalTime`, `LocalDateTime`, `ZonedDateTime`, and more.

```java
LocalDate currentDate = LocalDate.now();
System.out.println(currentDate); // Output: 2024-05-03

LocalTime currentTime = LocalTime.now();
System.out.println(currentTime); // Output: 15:30:45.123456789
```
### Collection Framework (Lists, Sets, Maps)
The Collection Framework provides a set of interfaces and classes for storing and manipulating groups of objects. Key interfaces include `List`, `Set`, and `Map`, with implementations such as `ArrayList`, `HashSet`, and `HashMap`.

```java
// Creating a list
List<String> names = new ArrayList<>();
names.add("Alice");
names.add("Bob");
names.add("Charlie");

// Creating a set
Set<Integer> numbers = new HashSet<>();
numbers.add(1);
numbers.add(2);
numbers.add(3);

// Creating a map
Map<String, Integer> scores = new HashMap<>();
scores.put("Alice", 85);
scores.put("Bob", 92);
scores.put("Charlie", 78);
```
### Input and Output (I/O) Operations
The Java I/O API allows you to perform input and output operations in Java programs. It includes classes for reading and writing data from/to various sources, such as files, streams, and network connections.

```java
// Reading from a file
try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("input.txt"))) {
    String line;
    while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
        System.out.println(line);
    }
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}

// Writing to a file
try (BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("output.txt"))) {
    writer.write("Hello, World!");
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```
### Serialization
Serialization is the process of converting Java objects into a stream of bytes for storage or transmission. Java provides built-in support for serialization through the `Serializable` interface and classes like `ObjectInputStream` and `ObjectOutputStream`.

```java
// Serializing an object
try (ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream("data.ser"))) {
    out.writeObject(object);
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}

// Deserializing an object
try (ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream("data.ser"))) {
    Object object = in.readObject();
} catch (IOException | ClassNotFoundException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```
### Conclusion
The Java Standard Library offers a rich set of functionalities that simplify common programming tasks, ranging from string manipulation to date and time handling, collection management, I/O operations, and serialization. By leveraging these components, Java developers can build robust and efficient applications with ease.
