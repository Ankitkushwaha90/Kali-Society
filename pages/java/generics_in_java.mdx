# Generics in Java

Generics in Java allow you to create classes, interfaces, and methods that operate on various types while providing compile-time type safety. They enable you to write reusable and type-safe code. In this tutorial, we'll explore the fundamentals of generics in Java.

## Introduction to Generics

Generics were introduced in Java 5 to address the issue of type safety and to enable the creation of type-parameterized classes and methods. They allow you to define classes and methods with placeholder types that are specified when the class or method is used.

```java
// Generic class example
public class Box<T> {
    private T content;

    public void setContent(T content) {
        this.content = content;
    }

    public T getContent() {
        return content;
    }
}

// Using a generic class
Box<Integer> integerBox = new Box<>();
integerBox.setContent(10);
int value = integerBox.getContent();
```
### Generic Classes
A generic class in Java is a class that can operate on any data type. It is defined with one or more type parameters enclosed in angle brackets (`<>`). These type parameters can be used as placeholders for actual types when the class is instantiated.

```java
public class Box<T> {
    // Class definition with type parameter T
}
``` 
### Generic Methods
Similar to generic classes, Java allows you to define generic methods that can operate on any type. Generic methods can have their own type parameters, independent of the type parameters of the class they belong to.

```java
public class Utils {
    // Generic method example
    public static <T> void printArray(T[] array) {
        for (T element : array) {
            System.out.print(element + " ");
        }
        System.out.println();
    }
}
```
### Wildcards
Wildcards in Java generics allow you to specify a range of acceptable types when working with generic classes or methods. There are three types of `wildcards: ?`, `? extends`, and `? super`.

- `?`: Represents an unknown type.
- `? extends T`: Represents any type that is a subtype of `T`.
- `? super T`: Represents any type that is a supertype of `T`.

```java
public void printList(List<?> list) {
    for (Object obj : list) {
        System.out.print(obj + " ");
    }
    System.out.println();
}
```
### Conclusion
Generics in Java provide a powerful mechanism for creating reusable, type-safe code. By using generics, you can write classes and methods that operate on a wide range of data types while ensuring compile-time type safety. Understanding generics is essential for writing robust and flexible Java programs.
