# Module 4: Control Flow Statements

Control flow statements in Java allow you to control the flow of execution in your programs based on certain conditions or loops. In this module, we'll cover conditional statements, switch statement, loops, break, and continue statements.

## Conditional Statements (if, else-if, else)

Conditional statements in Java allow you to execute different blocks of code based on the evaluation of a boolean expression. The basic syntax for if-else statements is as follows:

```java
if (condition) {
    // code block to be executed if the condition is true
} else if (anotherCondition) {
    // code block to be executed if anotherCondition is true
} else {
    // code block to be executed if all conditions are false
}
```
Example:

```java
int num = 10;
if (num > 0) {
    System.out.println("Positive number");
} else if (num < 0) {
    System.out.println("Negative number");
} else {
    System.out.println("Zero");
}
```
### Switch Statement
The switch statement evaluates an expression and executes code blocks based on matching cases. It provides an alternative to long if-else chains. The syntax for the switch statement is as follows:

```java
switch (expression) {
    case value1:
        // code block
        break;
    case value2:
        // code block
        break;
    ...
    default:
        // code block to be executed if none of the cases match
}
```
Example:

```java
int day = 3;
switch (day) {
    case 1:
        System.out.println("Monday");
        break;
    case 2:
        System.out.println("Tuesday");
        break;
    ...
    default:
        System.out.println("Invalid day");
}
```
### Loops (while, do-while, for)
Loops in Java allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly. There are three types of loops in Java:

- while loop: Executes a block of code repeatedly as long as a condition is true.
- do-while loop: Similar to the while loop, but the code block is executed at least once before the condition is checked.
- for loop: Executes a block of code repeatedly for a fixed number of times.
Example:

```java
// while loop
int i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
}

// do-while loop
int j = 0;
do {
    System.out.println(j);
    j++;
} while (j < 5);

// for loop
for (int k = 0; k < 5; k++) {
    System.out.println(k);
}
```
### Break and Continue Statements
The `break` statement is used to exit a loop prematurely, while the `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration and continue with the next iteration. These statements are often used within loops to control their flow.

Example:

```java
// break statement
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    if (i == 5) {
        break; // exit the loop when i equals 5
    }
    System.out.println(i);
}

// continue statement
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    if (i == 2) {
        continue; // skip iteration when i equals 2
    }
    System.out.println(i);
}
```
That's it for this module on control flow statements in Java! In the next module, we'll explore arrays and their manipulation.
