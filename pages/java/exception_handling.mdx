# Exception Handling in Java

Exception handling is a mechanism used to handle runtime errors (exceptions) in Java programs. It allows you to gracefully handle unexpected situations that may arise during program execution. In this tutorial, we'll cover the key aspects of exception handling in Java.

## Understanding Exceptions

An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program and disrupts the normal flow of instructions. Exceptions can occur for various reasons, such as invalid input, file not found, or division by zero. In Java, exceptions are represented by objects of type `Throwable` or its subclasses.

```java
try {
    // Code that may throw an exception
    int result = 10 / 0; // Division by zero
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    // Handle the exception
    System.out.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
}
```
### try-catch Block
The `try-catch` block is used to handle exceptions in Java. The `try` block contains the code that may throw an exception, and the catch block is used to `catch` and handle the exception if it occurs.

```java
try {
    // Code that may throw an exception
} catch (ExceptionType1 e1) {
    // Handle ExceptionType1
} catch (ExceptionType2 e2) {
    // Handle ExceptionType2
} finally {
    // Code to be executed regardless of whether an exception occurred
}
```
### Multiple Catch Blocks
You can have multiple `catch` blocks to handle different types of exceptions separately. This allows you to handle exceptions more precisely based on their types.

```java
try {
    // Code that may throw an exception
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    // Handle arithmetic exception
} catch (NullPointerException e) {
    // Handle null pointer exception
} catch (Exception e) {
    // Handle other exceptions
}
```
### finally Block
The `finally` block is used to execute code that needs to be executed regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. It is typically used for cleanup tasks such as closing resources (e.g., files, database connections).

```java
FileInputStream inputStream = null;
try {
    inputStream = new FileInputStream("file.txt");
    // Code to read from the file
} catch (IOException e) {
    // Handle file I/O exception
} finally {
    // Close the input stream
    if (inputStream != null) {
        try {
            inputStream.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            // Handle close exception
        }
    }
}
```
### Custom Exceptions
In addition to built-in exceptions, you can also create custom exceptions to handle specific error conditions in your applications. Custom exceptions should extend the `Exception` class or one of its subclasses.

```java
public class CustomException extends Exception {
    public CustomException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}

// Throwing a custom exception
try {
    throw new CustomException("Custom error message");
} catch (CustomException e) {
    System.out.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
}
```

### calculator
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Calculator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        System.out.println("Welcome to the Calculator!");
        System.out.println("Available operations: +, -, *, /");
        System.out.print("Enter the first number: ");
        double num1 = scanner.nextDouble();
        System.out.print("Enter the operator: ");
        char operator = scanner.next().charAt(0);
        System.out.print("Enter the second number: ");
        double num2 = scanner.nextDouble();
        
        double result = 0;
        switch (operator) {
            case '+':
                result = num1 + num2;
                break;
            case '-':
                result = num1 - num2;
                break;
            case '*':
                result = num1 * num2;
                break;
            case '/':
                if (num2 != 0) {
                    result = num1 / num2;
                } else {
                    System.out.println("Error: Division by zero!");
                    return;
                }
                break;
            default:
                System.out.println("Error: Invalid operator!");
                return;
        }
        
        System.out.println("Result: " + result);
        scanner.close();
    }
}

```
### Conclusion
Exception handling is an essential aspect of Java programming, allowing you to write robust and reliable code that gracefully handles unexpected errors. By understanding how to use try-catch blocks, multiple catch blocks, finally block, and custom exceptions, you'll be better equipped to handle exceptions effectively in your Java applications.
